**Abstract**

The demand for improved signal integrity and higher data rates in modern communication systems necessitates the development of high-frequency phase-locked loops (PLLs) to ensure accurate timing and synchronization in various applications. This report focuses on the design and analysis of digitally controlled oscillators (DCOs) utilizing forced stack transistor-based inverters and PMOS varactors. The proposed design aims to enhance power efficiency, frequency stability, and overall performance of DCOs in high-speed communication systems. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate the efficacy of the design in achieving a wide frequency tuning range, low power consumption, and improved phase noise characteristics​.

**Theory**

The design of the DCO centers on the use of stacked inverters composed of PMOS and NMOS transistors. These transistors are configured in pairs to form the core of the oscillator circuit. The stacking of transistors is a crucial technique to reduce leakage currents and enhance circuit stability. Additionally, the integration of PMOS varactors allows for fine-tuning of the oscillator frequency by varying the load capacitance. Control signals are strategically employed to adjust the frequency, providing precise control over the output signal.

**Design Methodology**

**Inverter Configuration:** The core of the DCO consists of inverter pairs (PMOS P1, P2 and NMOS N1, N2) arranged in a forced stack configuration. This setup ensures reduced leakage current and improved control over the oscillation frequency.

**Power Supply Distribution:** The power supply (Vdd) is connected at multiple points within the circuit to ensure adequate power distribution, enhancing the stability and performance of the transistors.

**Control Signals:** Signals labeled A, B, and C are used to tune the oscillator frequency. These signals adjust the effective capacitance and resistance in the circuit, allowing for precise frequency control​.

**Capacitive Loads:** PMOS varactors are integrated into the design to enable fine-tuning of the frequency by adjusting the load capacitance. This results in a more stable and efficient oscillator.
